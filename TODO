Timeouts
    * slow responses? (feasable? just let TCP do it?)

psgi.input streaming

    * add a "poll_cb()" method to the psgi.input handle as an extension?  EV
    gets to schedule the watcher in that case rather than bleeding the fd to
    the handler.
    * related: Connection: close bodies
    * related: Transfer-Encoding: chunked bodies

IO::Handle-like responses

    * check if it's got a real file descriptor? optimize (libeio or similar
    for non-blocking sendfile?) (v1.1)
    * wait for readability using an ev watcher? (v1.1)

streamed responses

    * instead of an implicit "low water mark" of 0 for the poll_cb
    writer-object callback, a configurable number of bytes can be used.

Handle requests that don't require a body (optional entities).

    * Related: allow overriding the "if entity has a C-L, wait for it" during request
    start (not sure if there's a PSGI-compatible way to do this)
    * different request timeout logic will be needed.

Optimize env-hash

    * allow Feersum apps to specify which vars will be needed (v1.1)
    ** will this even be a win?
    * maybe use uvar magic for PSGI if using Perl v5.10.0 (Variable::Magic
    style?) (v1.1)

Perf idea: Un-corked reads - should newly accepted handles wait or just try
read right away?

multiple Feersum threads, one Perl thread?

WebSocket support (v1.1)

    * http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-socket-protocol/
    * Support psgix.io and Web::Hippie already (0.981), but would be good to
    accelerate it.
    * Do the handshake in C/XS, call request_handler once request is complete.
    * I/O is done using the streaming interface (buffered)
    * requires random numbers (drand48?) and an MD5 implementation (link
    openssl? use the guts of Digest::MD5 somehow?)
    * make this a separate module since if it brings in an openssl deps.
    * will this work for PSGI? magic psgix.web_socket or something?

Release t/Utils.pm's "simple_client" as "anyevent::anotherhttp" or something?

accept4
    * available on newer linuxes, saves calls to fcntl for setting NONBLOCK
    and CLOEXEC

JSON accelleration?
    * can write_json() an element in an array of things? automagically call JSON::XS stuff?
    * middleware with XS-accellerator?

True pre-forking support
    * serialize accept() calls
