Timeouts
    * slow headers
    * slow bodies
    * slow responses? (feasable? just let TCP do it?)

psgi.input streaming

    * add a "read_cb()" method to the psgi.input handle as an extension?  EV
    gets to schedule the watcher in that case rather than bleeding the fd to
    the handler.
    * related: Connection: close bodies
    * related: Transfer-Encoding: chunked bodies

allow streaming responses to be HTTP/1.0 "Connection: close" rather than
HTTP/1.1 "Transfer-Encoding: chunked".

    * maybe match up the streaming flavour with the request version?

Handle requests that don't require a body (optional entities).

Better EV-callback error handling.

Lazy I/O watcher initialization?

Per-client "drain" and "completion" callbacks?

Per-client data (for attaching guards).

Translate sockaddr/etc. and put in env hash.

Un-corked reads - should newly accepted handles wait or just try read right
away?

sendfile via libeio/IO::AIO ?

multiple Feersum threads, one Perl thread?
